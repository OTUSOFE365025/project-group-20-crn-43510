| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| UC-1: Query Academic Information | A student asks the assistant a question through the text or voice interface. The student gets authenticated through the SSA and then the system takes the user input as a natural language query. The system will then use AI models to interpret the query. Now, the system will retrieve the relevant data from the integrated university systems (LMS, registration database, calendar, etc). A response is generated in the student's preferred language and it gets delivered within 2 seconds. After it gets delivered, the interaction between the student and the system gets stored so the system can personalize future responses, using this interaction as context. |
| UC-2: Manage Personal Academic Dashboard | A student accesses their personalized dashboard to check their schedule, lectures, or other academic information. This can be through mobile, web, or other devices. The student views upcoming deadlines, tests/exams, schedule changes, and announcements retrieved from connected data sources (calendar, registration database, etc). The student can change their language settings, and they can also export different calendar events to external calendar apps like Google Calendar. The student customizes their reminders, schedules, and UI however they please, and all of these changes are updated and saved by the system. |
| UC-3: Manage Course Content & Analytics | A lecturer manages course materials (lecture slides, notes) and views student performance metrics. The lecturer adds or updates course content using conversational commands, and the system publishes it to the LMS once their authorization gets verified. The lecturer queries for summarized class statistics including attendance tracking, engagement metrics, and average grades for the class. Any drops in attendance, or grades, or any other anomalies get automatically detected and reported to the lecturer. |
| UC-4: Communicate with Students | The lecturer creates announcements/reminders that get sent to the students in their course. The announcements only get sent to the students after the system verifies the lecturer's authorization, and confirms the announcement details. The alerts get distributed through multiple channels including the app, and email. The lecturer can set automated reminders for upcoming deadlines, and other important dates. The system creates the scheduled task, and automatically sends the reminder at the specified time. |
| UC-5: Configure System Integrations & Policies | An administrator sets up connections to external systems (LMS, registration system, calendar, email services, etc) and defines institutional policies. The admin then reviews and updates the status of connections to the external systems. The admin updates integration settings like API endpoints, authentication credentials, and data sync intervals. The system validates each configuration change and it tests connectivity with the external systems. The admin defines and changes global policies including data retention periods, and privacy compliance rules which are enforced system-wide. |
| UC-6: Monitor & Maintain System Health | A system maintainer watches over and maintains system health and performance. Performance metrics, and model accuracy data get logged continuously for analysis. The maintainer accesses the monitoring dashboard in order to review real-time metrics including response latency, service availability, and AI model accuracy. Whenever updates are needed, the maintainer uses the continuous deployment pipeline to perform a zero-downtime deployment so that the update goes through and the system stays available for users. These updates are used to add new services, improve existing services, or to improve response quality. The maintainer creates backups of user data to ensure user data doesn't get lost or destroyed. The system handles external data source failures well, it does so by using automatic retry mechanisms and it alerts the system maintainer if the problems persist. |
