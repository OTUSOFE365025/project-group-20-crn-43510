As universities adopt more and more emerging technologies, the complexity of dealing with scholarly systems, processes, and communications processes has also grown. Modern universities are now reliant on multiple external systems such as Learning Management Systems (LMS), registration databases, calendar systems, and email services to coordinate their processes. But as these systems do not have seamless interoperability among them, inefficiencies, information lags, communication breakdowns, and stakeholders' workload increase are prevalent.

The following poses challenges for the students, lecturers, administrators, system maintainers, and external data systems that the university depends upon. Students struggle with accessing prompt and precise academic information, lecturers struggle with keeping content and analytics in check, administrators waste time having to manually configure and manage system integration, and system maintainers work overtime to ensure that the digital ecosystem in the institution is properly working.

In overcoming these inefficiencies, the AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is proposed. The platform will serve as a smart, composite interface that integrates with all of the key university systems and provides real-time, accurate, personalized assistance in text and voice forms. Employing advanced artificial intelligence and natural language processing, AIDAP will be capable of interpreting user queries, acquiring and summarizing information, performing mundane tasks, and enabling efficient communication among all the stakeholders.

AIDAP enables greater operational productivity by enabling access to academic information, enabling automated announcements and reminders, enabling real-time monitoring of the system, and enabling role-based interactions for system maintainers, lecturers, administrators, and students. With this intelligent central assistant, universities can automate their operations, reduce user frustration, improve decision-making from analytics, and respond to modern expectations of digital convenience.

Generally, AIDAP is a modern, scalable, and secure response to institutional academic operation management, significantly improving users' experience and communication in the entire university context.
